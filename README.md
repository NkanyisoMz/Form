# Form Odin Project

Welcome to my project! This project is part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I'm developing essential skills in web development. This project focuses on [insert project type, e.g., building a form, creating a game, etc.].


## About the Project

This project is part of the curriculum for The Odin Project, specifically in the [intermediate-html-and-css/sign-up-form]. The goal was to learn to use intermediate elements of html and css such as css functions, opacity of colour, oflow of elements, pseudo elements, css frameworks such boostrap, and web fonts to name the least.
Through this project, I was able to deepen my understanding of the concepts previously mentioned though some were practised separately and not included in the project.

- **HTML5**: for building the structure of the page
